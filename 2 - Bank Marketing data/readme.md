In today's data-driven business landscape, organizations rely heavily on customer data to gain valuable insights and make
informed decisions. However, raw data often comes in a format that is not immediately suitable for analysis, requiring data 
wrangling and feature engineering techniques to transform it into a usable state.


This can be a significant challenge, especially in the banking industry where customer information is crucial for improving 
marketing strategies and enhancing customer experiences. Without proper data wrangling and feature engineering, banks may 
struggle to gain meaningful insights from their customer data, leading to suboptimal marketing strategies and poor customer 
experiences.


In this hands-on project, we will apply data wrangling and feature engineering techniques using Python and the pandas library 
to clean, transform, and enrich a real-world bank marketing dataset. By applying techniques such as discretization, binning, 
and creating dummy variables, we will prepare the data for subsequent steps in the data analysis pipeline, enabling banks to 
gain actionable insights that drive data-driven decision-making.
